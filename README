pyTHANE 0.5.0 - An Asset Editor For Naev
by Cypher

Licensed under GPLv3


pyTHANE lets you graphically edit the asset.xml file in naev, adding new planets/stations and editing their parameters.

Currently, you can only edit the name, description, bar description, virtual status (true/false), and services.

Requirements:

Python 2.7 or better (I am using 2.7, but I am guessing 2.6 would also work)
lxml
qt4
pyqt4
