pyTHANE 0.5.0 - An Asset Editor For Naev
by Cypher

Licensed under GPLv3


pyTHANE lets you graphically edit the asset.xml file in naev, adding new planets/stations and editing their parameters.

Currently, you can edit the name, description, bar description, virtual status (true/false), services, and landing/exterior pictures.

Requirements:

Python 2.6 or better
lxml
qt4
pyqt4

pyuic4 (only if you want to modify the .ui files with Qt Designer, this is needed to compile them into .py files)

For windows, you can get qt and pyqt by installing pyqt:

PyQt-Py2.7-x86-gpl-4.8.4-1.exe (or 2.6 if you have that version of Python)



Be sure to set your Naev directory in /src/asset.conf before you launch the program
