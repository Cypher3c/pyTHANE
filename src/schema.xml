 <Assets>
  <Attribs>
   <attrib name = "Is_virtual" xpath = "virtual" type = "flag">False</attrib>
   <attrib name = "X_pos" xpath = "pos/x" type = "attrib">None</attrib>
   <attrib name = "Y_pos" xpath = "pos/y" type = "attrib">None</attrib>
   <attrib name = "Space_GFX" xpath = "GFX/space" type = "attrib">None</attrib>
