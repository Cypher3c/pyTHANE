   <description>Adham is a cold, lifeless planet. The only reason why there is a landing strip here at all is that the planet hosts the three arctic-themed arenas for Totoran's gladiatiorial games. While the landing zone and a small buffer around it is considered neutral territory, most of the planet's surface is subject to the destructive sport that is so popular among Totoran's visitors.</description>
